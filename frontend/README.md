# publicmedia - frontend

## Getting started

```bash
# all commands used in ./frontend
cd frontend

# install tools and frontend dependencies
pnpm install
```

Create environment files for `development mode` and `production mode`.

```bash
cp src/environments/environment.ts src/environments/environment.dev.ts
cp src/environments/environment.ts src/environments/environment.prod.ts
```

**Note**: These files will not be under version control but listed in .gitignore.

## Usage

### Recommendation

It is recommanded to use a server to get full access of all angular.
For the other options your app should run on a server which you like.

### Run in development mode

```bash
# build, reachable on http://localhost/app/path/to/dist/
pnpm build:dev

# build and starts a server, rebuild after changes, reachable on http://localhost:4200/
pnpm start

# build and starts a server, rebuild after changes, reachable on http://localhost:4200/ with proxy to prevent errors on instagram
pnpm proxy
```

### Package

```bash
# build in production mode, compressed
pnpm build:prod
```

### Tests

```bash
# test
ng test

# e2e
ng e2e
```

## Configuration

### General

All options have to been set in the environment files but some of them do not need to be changed.
All defaults refer to the environment file (`environment.ts`), they are prepared in `development mode` (`environment.dev.ts`).
Change for `production mode` the option `production` to `true`.
